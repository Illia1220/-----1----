                            <li>Sedans: These are the most common type of passenger vehicle, known for their comfortable interiors, efficient fuel consumption, and spacious cabins. They typically have four doors and a separate trunk.</li>
                            <li>SUVs (Sport Utility Vehicles): These vehicles offer more ground clearance and can be equipped with all-wheel drive or four-wheel drive, making them ideal for off-road or inclement weather driving. They also have more cargo and passenger space.</li>
                            <li>Coupes: Typically two-door cars, coupes are sporty and often have a sleeker, more stylish design. They are generally smaller than sedans and are popular among those looking for a more performance-oriented driving experience.</li>
                            <li>Convertibles: Convertibles have a retractable roof, allowing the driver and passengers to enjoy an open-air driving experience. These cars often come in sporty or luxury designs.</li>
                            <li>Trucks: Pickup trucks are designed for carrying heavy loads and performing tough tasks. They are often used by businesses, farmers, and individuals who need a vehicle with towing and cargo capacity.</li>
                            <li>Electric Vehicles (EVs): Powered by electricity rather than gasoline, electric cars are becoming more popular due to concerns about environmental impact and the desire to reduce reliance on fossil fuels. Leading models include the Tesla Model S and Nissan Leaf.</li>
