            <p><h2>Nissan Skyline</h2>

                The Nissan Skyline is an iconic Japanese sports car that has been part of Nissan's lineup for several decades. Originally introduced in 1957, it became a performance legend starting with the R32 generation, which was launched in the late 1980s. The Skyline became even more famous worldwide when it gained a reputation for high performance and tuning potential, particularly with the introduction of the R32 GT-R in 1989. The modern Skyline is now part of the Nissan GT-R family, with the latest model continuing the legacy of performance and technological advancement.
